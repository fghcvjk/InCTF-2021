We sent Michael over to the Union Depository to collect data from one of their systems for the heist. We were able to retrieve the data, but it looks like they were able to read the message sent to us that Michael had typed from their system. Fortunately, he took the memory dump before escaping the building. Analyze the memory dump and find out how the message was compromised.
